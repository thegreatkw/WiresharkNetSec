<h1>Wireshark for Network Security Analysis</h1>
</br>
<h2>Description</h2>

• Practiced troubleshooting with Wireshark, captured traffic and analyzed acquired traffic. Used display and capture filters to examine details.</br>
• Generated, captured and analyzed RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and Telnet unencrypted traffic. Decrypted a RADIUS encrypted password.</br>
• Generated, captured and analyzed SSH and HTTPS encrypted Traffic. Decrypted HTTPS traffic in Wireshark.</br>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

• Wireshark</br>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<i>• <b>1.</b> Using Wireshark and most of its functionalities: capturing some network traffic that is flowing through your machine now and analyzing captured network traffic by opening a stored capture file.</i></br>

<i>• <b>2.</b> Generating and capturing RADIUS Traffic, analyzing and viewing it in Wireshark. Knowing what the RADIUS Architecture consists of and decrypting the encrypted password using Wireshark.</i></br>

<i>• <b>3.</b> Knowing the basics about HTTP, and knowing the difference between Wireshark’s Filters. Connecting to an HTTP Server and initiate a Basic HTTP Authentication and capturing its Traffic on Wireshark.</i></br>



<i>• <b>4.</b> Initiating an HTTP Form-based authentication, capturing it in Wireshark and analyzing it so you can see the username and password clearly. Also Capturing DNS Traffic.</i></br>

<i>• <b>5.</b> Knowing how Telnet works, starting a Telnet Session with a remote Device using Powershell, capturing its traffic in Wireshark and analyzing it from the Security perspective.</i></br>

<i>• <b>6.</b> Opening a SSH Session, capturing the traffic and comparing it with the Telnet's. Capturing traffic based on the host and how to see different conversations that have happened in a certain Capture.</i></br>

<i>• <b>7.</b> Generating and capturing HTTPS Traffic, also decrypting captured HTTPS Traffic in Wireshark.</i></br>
