<h1>Wireshark for Network Security Analysis</h1>
</br>
<h2>Description</h2>

• Practiced troubleshooting with Wireshark, captured traffic and analyzed acquired traffic. Used display and capture filters to examine details.</br>
• Generated, captured and analyzed RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and Telnet unencrypted traffic. Decrypted a RADIUS encrypted password.</br>
• Generated, captured and analyzed SSH and HTTPS encrypted Traffic. Decrypted HTTPS traffic in Wireshark.</br>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

• Wireshark</br>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<i>• <b>1.</b> Used Wireshark and much of its functionalities to capture network traffic currently flowing and analyzing traffic by opening a stored pcap file.</i></br>

<i>• <b>2.</b> Generated and captured RADIUS traffic. Analyzed and viewed in Wireshark. Reviewed RADIUS architecture elements and decrypted the password using Wireshark.</i></br>

<i>• <b>3.</b> Reviewed the basics of HTTP and analyzed the differences between Wireshark’s filters. Connected to an HTTP server and initiated HTTP authentication. Captured the traffic in Wireshark.</i></br>


<i>• <b>4.</b> Initiated HTTP form-based authentication and captured in Wireshark. Identified the username and password in the form POST and recognized the vulnerabilities in an HTTP form.</i></br>

<i>• <b>5.</b> Started a telnet session with a remote device using Powershell and captured traffic in Wireshark. Analyzed the capture from a security perspective.</i></br>

<i>• <b>6.</b> Opened an SSH session and captured the traffic. Compared the results to telnet. Filtered traffic based on the host and recognized different conversations that can occur within a single capture.</i></br>

<i>• <b>7.</b> Generated and captured HTTPS traffic and decrypted the HTTPS traffic in Wireshark.</i></br>
